                <h2>Generic Drugs in India</h2>

                <p>
                    In India, many people are influenced by the brand name of a product. For them, the brand name matters not only in cosmetics, clothes, grocery, accessories but also in case of medicines. They have a common notion that generic drugs are available at a low price so they may be of inferior quality.</p>
                <p>
                    But let’s find out the reality!</p>
                <p>
                    Generic drugs have a similar chemical composition as the branded drugs. They are accepted globally and are of the same quality with a lesser cost as compared to branded drugs. Moreover, it is easier to get generic medicines directly from online pharmacy 24/7 or in a nearby chemist shop. The generics prove to be a great alternative to branded medicines as they are bioequivalent or identical to branded drugs with comparable therapeutic action. Along with no compromise with the quality, it is also cost-effective as the cost of research and development and drug discovery is not included in the case of generic drugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    India is the third largest manufacturer of generic drugs in the world. Currently, Indian Pharmaceutical Firms supplies 80% of anti-retroviral medications globally. But, there is a lack of awareness regarding the significance of generic medicines.<br>
                    – For the OTC (over the counter) drugs, many people are aware of brand names of the drug rather than the generic name of the medicine.<br>
                    – In most of the cases, chemists give the medicines which are written on the prescription, and also the doctors prescribe a brand-name drug upon request, even when there’s a generic available.<br>
                    – Generic drugs do not get enough promotions.
                </p>
                <p>These reasons contribute to the lack of awareness of generic medicines. So it is not only the responsibility of the government to support generics, but we all should also take the initiative to support generics. Recently these initiatives are already started by few state governments in India.</p>
